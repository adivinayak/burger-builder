                        In this exercise, the idea is to write a paragraph that would be a random passage from a story. An effective paragraph is one that has unity (it isnâ€™t a hodgepodge of things), focus (everything in the paragraph stacks up to the whatever-it-is the paragraph is about), and coherence (the content follows smoothly). For this exercise, the paragraph should be quick to read--say, not be more than 100 words long.

                                  
                                    
                          </div>
    
    
           </div>



        </Fade>
